# Verbatim Strings

| Pros                             | Cons                                        |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Escape characters simplification | Limited flexibility with certain characters |
| Multi-line strings               | Potential for trailing white space          |
| Improved readbility              | Not ideal for short or simple strings       |
|                                  |                                             |
